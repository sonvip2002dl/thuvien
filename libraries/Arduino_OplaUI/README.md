This Arduino library provides user interface helpers and widgets for the [Arduino Oplà IoT](https://store.arduino.cc/opla-iot-kit) Kit and the [MKR IoT Carrier](http://store.arduino.cc/mkr-iot-carrier).

With this library you can use the features of the device (round display, colored LEDs, buzzer and touch buttons) to create an interactive user interface.

Features:

* 4 styles of gauges
* widget framework that makes it easy to combine multiple independent widgets in a single application (gauge, string, bool)
* use touch buttons to increase/decrease values

> See the [library home page](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/) and the [examples](examples/) for more information about this library and its usage.
